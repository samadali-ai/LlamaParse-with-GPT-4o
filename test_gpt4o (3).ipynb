      "Climate change is reaching alarming levels in large part due to emissions from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation. In 2016, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration levels in the atmosphere exceeded the 400 parts per million threshold on a sustained basis - a level that climate scientists believe will have a catastrophic impact on the environment. Worse, annual global CO2 emissions continue to increase and have approximately doubled over the past 50 years to over 43 gigatons in 2019. The world’s current path is unwise and unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world cannot reduce CO2 emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption. And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors. We are focused on creating a complete energy and transportation ecosystem from solar generation and energy storage to all-electric vehicles that produce zero tailpipe emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the onset of shelter-in-place orders and travel restrictions due to COVID-19, we have seen dramatic increases in air quality across the planet, as well as projections for CO2 emissions to drop in excess of 4% in 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, according to researchers. Because these improvements in air quality and reductions in CO2 are a result of a global economic disruption and not due to systemic changes in how we produce and consume energy, they are not expected to be sustained absent intervention. However, these changes have shown us the positive impacts of reduced pollution in a very short period of time. At Tesla, we believe that we all have an unprecedented opportunity to learn from this disruption and accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions as part of a recovery for all economies throughout the world, and we will actively continue to advocate for the realization of these long-term changes.\n",
